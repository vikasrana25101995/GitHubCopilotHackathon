Problem:- Build a simple URL shortener service using Ruby and the Sinatra web framework. The service should accept a long URL as input, generate a unique short URL and store the mapping in a suitable data structure. Demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for implementing the URL shortening algorithm, handling user input, and managing the data store.

Solution Approach:-

1.) check if the url is valid or not
2.) if the url is valid then shorten the url
3.) store the actual url with the shorten url so that we can redirect to that url
